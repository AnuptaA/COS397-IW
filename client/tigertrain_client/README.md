This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## ChatGPT API Instructions
(N/B: The API doesn't yet have access to the question image)
(N/B: The API only works for traversal questions at the moment)

Install the following packages using npm:

- npm install axios
- npm install @types/node --save-dev
- npm install dotenv
- npm install openai
- npm install marked

Make a file called ".env.local" in the tigertrain_client/components folder

Paste into the .env.local file the details sent over text

How to hit the API:
    - Pick your favorite traversal question
    - Enter a wrong answer then hit 'submit'
    - Wait a few seconds (if its more than like 5 seconds, something may have gone wrong, check browser logs to confirm)
